I'm not sure when things changed for me. I know there was a string of events that led me to this point. I had just moved to New York. I left almost everything behind to start something new. My fiance and I decided to just go for it and move -- he wanted to work on Broadway and I wanted to work in a museum. Things started out okay. We found a great apartment in FiDi (actually next door to Flatiron School). My fiance started looking for shows and I was trying to decide between continuing school or finding a job. I did a bit of both and landed a retail job to hold me over until I could figure out exactly what I wanted to do.

This was my first time I was really unhappy with my life. I would have panic attacks before my shift would start. I just couldn't do it. I took some time off and visited home (Ohio). Thankfully, it is only a short drive away. I came back to the city and started looking for another job. I came across this amazing fashion startup and was finally on track to settling into life in the city. I was making friends and had a job that paid decently well. The company had a great mission and I was excited to be a part of a company that was changing lives. Fast foward a year and my life started becoming this sad shell of who I used to be. 

I was no longer happy at my job -- we moved to mostly remote work, which led me to be more of a hermit than I already was. Job growth seemed minimal and I was no longer being asked to help on special projects (instead they were attracking the new hires to seem like the job was better than it was). Even when I voiced my opinion on this, they seemed to not care about a loyal employee of 14 months. Here is when my depression began to hit an all time low. I would put off working as much as I could (we could work our hours anytime during the day as long as it was before midnight). I became this machine that just did my work, with minimal effort, day in and day out. 

I decided I needed a change. My fiance and I took a long weekend away for me to find some clarity and to get away from it all. That weeked changed everything. I first read about Flatiron School last August. As someone who always loved video games, it never occured to me to look into programming. I was excited. For the first time in 6 months, I was excited about this new adventure. I didn't know a lot about programming but I love learning new things. 

That changed once again. I started gaining an unexpected amount of weight and my depression was running rampant. I felt like a failure. I was seeing people on social media doing these amazing things and I felt like I was being left behind. I was a failure at life. I started having trouble sleeping, eating, and not wanting to do anything. I wouldn't leave the bedroom for days on end. I didn't want people to know that I was feeling this way because we had been taught by the media and our peers that mental health was something to be ashamed of. As much as I wanted to continue school, I struggled. I didn't want to fail.

I finally got help in February. I talked to a doctor and got medicated. 

I still have bad days and weeks. I struggle with wanting to do school work. I struggle sometimes with texting my best friend back. I want to be better. I know I can be better. I go in spurts of doing school for a few days and then not doing it at all. I started setting small goals for myself to help. 

I know I need to change. I know I can do this. This gave me so much joy when I quit my job and I started this journey. I want to find that joy. 

If anyone wants to be accountability partners on this journey, hit me up.
